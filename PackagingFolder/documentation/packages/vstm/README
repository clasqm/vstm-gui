vstm - Very Simple Todo Manager
Frank Villaro-Dixon - 2012

vstm is a simple todo manager who keeps your TODO things

To add a todo:
$ vstm [@priority] message

priority sets the task priority. It can be either a number, H (for high) or L.
Each TODO task is assigned a non static ID number.

To see the actual TODOs:
$ vstm

To delete a TODO:
$ vstm ID [ID2] [ID3]

As default, vstm uses the user DB file, located at: ~/.vstmDB. However, 
if you wish to use your own in a specific folder, simply touch(1)
./.vstmDB and it will use it, when in such folder.

Also, don't forget to take a look at src/vstm.h . There's a "whole" lot
of options available if you want to fiddle the program a bit.
